### Instructions for Running the Spectral Clustering Homework Code ###
First of all, python is needed. If you do not have it installed you can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The required modules for this project are:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- sklearn
- pandas
- wordcloud
  
You can install these modules using `pip` by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy sklearn pandas wordcloud

Install also the notebook interface:

```bash
pip install notebook

The code is in the file 'Gosmar_Maretto_HWSVD' which is intended to be run in a Jupyter Notebook. To launch a Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the directory containing your notebook and datasets, then run:

```bash
jupyter notebook

This will open a Jupyter interface in your browser. Choose the directory containing the project. 

Make sure the following files are present in the working directory where the code is executed:

Circle.csv
Spiral.csv
